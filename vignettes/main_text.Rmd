Whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR, while points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers. (c) Phenology metrics are in the unit of day of spore year (DOY) or days (for season lengths LOS, LAS), while intensity metrics are in the unit of (b) spores m–3 or (d) spores m–3 days. The abbreviations of metrics used in (b), (c), and (d) are defined in (a)."}

Solid black lines indicate significant (p < 0.05, t-test) slopes. Shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence intervals of the fixed effect. Points are individual years at individual stations. Colors are station-level Theil-Sen linear regression slopes, with warmer colors indicating earlier days of year, longer days, or higher intensity. The slope of colored lines are model-predicted station-level trends. The top row presents metrics defined in the ecological approach, while the bottom row shows metrics defined in the public health approach. Intensity metrics are transformed using the natural logarithm. To highlight trends, all intensity metrics are displayed on a natural logarithm scale, consistent with the transformations used during model fitting."}
